## Functionality 

* Navigation is built dynamically.
* It's clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link  scrolls to the appropriate section.
* A smooth scrolling behavior exsists in the project.

## Programing Languages
* A startup code was provided by Udacity (HTML,CSS)
* DOM Manipulation occured using JavaScript.

## Learning Outcomes

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, youâ€™ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.
